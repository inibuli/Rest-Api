# belajarapi

Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

In this Flutter Project we will learn about how to Make API Calls in Flutter using HTTP package.

Following are the steps we will take :

- First, let's create our flutter project
- Adding a package dependency to an app using flutter pub add
  To add the package, css_colors, to an app:
  Issue the command while being inside the project directory
  flutter pub add css_colors
  Import it
  Add a corresponding import statement in the Dart code.
  Stop and restart the app, if necessary
  If the package brings platform-specific code (Kotlin/Java for Android, Swift/Objective-C for iOS), that code must be built into your app. Hot reload and hot restart only update the Dart code, so a full restart of the app might be required to avoid errors like
  MissingPluginException when using the package.
  For more details, you can visit the Flutter documentation website (https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/using-packages)
- Next, we edit the main.dart file in the lib folder
- then in the lib folder create a screen folder and create a home.dart file
- In the home section we create a stateful widget and call api from randomuser.me
- we will call the user's first name, email and photo
- You can see the coding example in the home.dart file in the lib folder
- Run the project by pressing the round button at the bottom right of the screen
